# Question

Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we had a table of Flintstone family members that was forty characters in width, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?

```ruby
title = "Flintstone Family Members"
```

# Solution

```rb
title.center(40)
```

# Launch School Solution

```rb
title.center(40)
```
